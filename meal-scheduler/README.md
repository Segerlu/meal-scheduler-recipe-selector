# Meal Scheduler

This application will allow a user to select some recipes and add them to their favorites.
This should automatically update the favorites array.  
The scheduler will allow the user to either select their meals for the week or randomize them.  I would like to add functionality to allow for some to be chosen and the rest randomized.

This will create a grocery list for the user so they know what they need to purchase.  I can make the list items selectable so the user can cross out the things they already have.
